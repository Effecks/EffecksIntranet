<h1>Uploadble Files</h1>

<p>This plugin resides in the model layer. This makes it so you can have all the logic for uploading your files contained within you model.</p>

<h2>Important!</h2>

<p>This plugin follows the convention that you name your form field <em>singularModelName[property]</em>. If this is not the case then you can use the <em>uploadableFileFieldName</em> method provided to override the convention. This method is called on your model from within your controller action. An example is provided below in the <strong>Examples</strong> section.</p>

<h2>About:</h2>
<p>This plugin tries to make uploading files to your CFWheels application easy and secure (...well hopefully anyways).</p>
<p>This plugin is heavily based on <a href="http://github.com/rip747/cffileupload" target="_blank">CFFileUpload</a> project and has built in security to prevent the CFFILE MIME/FILE upload security vulnerability in coldfusion.</p>
<p>The way this plugin helps prevent this attack is by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Intercepting the desired destination directory of the upload and uploading to the ColdFusion Temp directory</li>
	<li>Makes sure that the mimetype of the file uploaded matches the proper extension for that mimtype (so you can't upload a file mimetype of <em>image/jpeg</em> and an extension of <em>cfm</em>)</li>
	<li>Makes sure that the extension of the uploaded file is allowed and not blacklisted</li>
	<li>Only after all security checks are passed is the file then moved to the original destination directory</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Also as a convience, the plugin returns the mimetype associated with the file within the cffile return struct.</em></p>

<h2>Security Vulnerability Information</h2>
<p>The following blog provide more information on spoofing mimetypes and getting around CFFILE's security checks.</p>

<h2>Methods Added:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		uploadableFile() - model
		<br/>called from within the your model for each property you want to upload files for.
	</li>
	<li>
		uploadableFileFieldName() - model
		<br/>called on the model but from the controller to override form field naming convertions.
		<br/>each argument corresponds to the property and form field name
		<br/>ex: &lt;cfset company.uploadableFileFieldName(logo="business[logo]", map="business[drivingdirections]")&gt;
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>For your convinence the default destination directory for all uploads is your application's <em>"files"</em> directory. You can change this by using the <em>"destination"</em> argument.</p>

<h2>Returns</h2>

<p>If successfull, the property will be set to the name of the file that was saved. When an error occurs it will add an error to the model with the error message you specify.</p>

<h2>Arguments:</h2>

<p><em>Besides all the normal arguments that the <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=Tags_f_10.html##3540091" target="_blank">[cffile action="upload"]</a> tag takes, you have the following addtional options.</em></p>
